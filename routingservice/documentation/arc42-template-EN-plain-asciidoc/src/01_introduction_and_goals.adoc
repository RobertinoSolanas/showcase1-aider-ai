== Introduction and Goals

The Routing Service is a microservice designed to provide Points of Interest (POI) data for navigation and location-based applications. It serves as a central component for retrieving geographical points of interest for various cities, supporting both real and mock data scenarios for development and testing purposes.

=== Requirements Overview

The primary requirements for the Routing Service include:
* Provide a RESTful API for retrieving Points of Interest by city
* Support mock data mode for development and testing environments
* Maintain extensible architecture for future integration with real data sources
* Ensure fast response times for POI queries
* Provide comprehensive API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
